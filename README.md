# Javascript-Timer
This is a simple countdown timer for your website.<br>
To add it to the site, you just need to create any element with a class on the page.<br>
In the javascript file, replace the contents of the variable with the desired date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"<br>
When calling setClock with the first argument, specify the element on the page in which the timer is created.
